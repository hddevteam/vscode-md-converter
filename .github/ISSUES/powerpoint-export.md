# [TASK] Implement PowerPoint Export Features (Slides to Images, Structure Export)

## ðŸ“‹ Development Task

### Task Description
Implement advanced PowerPoint export capabilities including slide-to-image conversion and structured data export for presentation analysis and archival.

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Export PowerPoint slides as individual high-quality images (PNG/JPG)
- [ ] Maintain aspect ratio and slide formatting
- [ ] Export presentation metadata and structure to JSON/XML
- [ ] Support different image formats and quality settings
- [ ] Batch export multiple presentations
- [ ] Create organized folder structure for exports
- [ ] Add configuration options for image quality and format
- [ ] Support page range selection for partial exports

### Technical Requirements
- Implement slide rendering to image functionality (evaluate `node-pptx`, `puppeteer`, `playwright`)
- Add structured data export capabilities
- Support multiple output formats (PNG, JPG, WebP)
- Image quality and resolution configuration
- Metadata extraction (slide count, author, creation date)
- File organization and naming conventions

### Implementation Notes
1. **Slide Rendering**:
   - Research rendering libraries for headless slide conversion
   - Consider using browser automation for accurate rendering
   - Implement fallback methods for different environments

2. **Image Output Options**:
   - Format: PNG (default), JPG, WebP
   - Quality: Low (72dpi), Medium (150dpi), High (300dpi)
   - Size: Original, Custom dimensions

3. **Structured Export**:
   ```json
   {
     "presentation": {
       "title": "Presentation Title",
       "author": "Author Name", 
       "slideCount": 10,
       "createdDate": "2025-07-05",
       "slides": [
         {
           "slideNumber": 1,
           "title": "Slide Title",
           "content": "Text content",
           "imageFile": "slide_001.png",
           "speakerNotes": "Notes content"
         }
       ]
     }
   }
   ```

4. **File Organization**:
   ```
   presentation_export/
   â”œâ”€â”€ images/
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ slide_001.png
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ slide_002.png
   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
   â”œâ”€â”€ presentation_structure.json
   â””â”€â”€ presentation_metadata.xml
   ```

### Testing Requirements
- [ ] Image quality and format tests
- [ ] Performance testing with large presentations
- [ ] Cross-platform rendering consistency
- [ ] Memory usage optimization tests
- [ ] Batch processing performance tests

### Dependencies
- Slide rendering library (research required)
- Image processing utilities (`sharp`, `jimp`)
- JSON/XML generation libraries
- File system operations for folder structure

### Related Issues
- Depends on PowerPoint parsing implementation
- Part of Advanced Document Processing v0.2.0
- May share code with PowerPoint to Markdown conversion

### Estimated Effort
- [x] 2-3 weeks
- [ ] 1 month+

**Breakdown**:
- Rendering library research and setup: 3-4 days
- Image export implementation: 4-5 days
- Structured data export: 2-3 days
- UI integration and configuration: 2-3 days
- Testing and optimization: 3-4 days

### Priority Level
- [ ] Critical
- [ ] High
- [x] Medium
- [ ] Low

### Labels
`enhancement`, `feature-request`, `development`, `v0.2.0`, `powerpoint`, `image-export`, `data-export`
