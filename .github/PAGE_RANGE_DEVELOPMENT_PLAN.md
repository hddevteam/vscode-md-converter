# Page Range Export Feature Development Plan

## 🎉 **MAJOR MILESTONE ACHIEVED - PDF FUNCTIONALITY COMPLETE**

### ✅ **RECENT USER EXPERIENCE IMPROVEMENTS (2025-01-19)**
- **Removed progress dialogs**: PDF page range export now executes directly without showing "正在导出指定页面..." dialog ✅
- **Fixed Chinese translations**: Changed "导出PDF页码到..." to "导出指定页码PDF到..." for better accuracy ✅
- **Unified folder naming**: PDF image export folder always named `filename_Images` regardless of page count ✅
- **Removed unnecessary options**: PDF to image conversion no longer shows output mode selection (merge/separate) ✅
- **Fixed mixed language messages**: Replaced "1 files" with proper internationalized "1 个文件" ✅
- **Simplified UI flow**: PDF image conversion uses dedicated `selectPageRangeForImages()` method ✅

### 🚧 **REVISED SCOPE: Focus on Practical Document Types**
**Decision**: Remove Word document support due to complex and impractical page concepts

**Remaining Work**:
- ✅ **PDF documents** → Text/Images with page ranges (COMPLETED & POLISHED)
- 🔄 **Excel files (.xlsx, .xls)** → Markdown/CSV with worksheet ranges  
- 🔄 **PowerPoint (.pptx, .ppt)** → Markdown with slide ranges

### 📅 Updated Development Plan
- **Phase 6**: Excel Worksheet Range Export (Not started)
- **Phase 7**: PowerPoint Slide Range Export (Not started)
- **Phase 8**: Cross-Document Testing (Not started)
- **Phase 9**: Manual Testing & Documentation (Ready to start)

## 🚀 Phase 6: Excel Worksheet Range Export

### Objectives
- Implement worksheet range selection for Excel files
- Support both .xlsx and .xls formats
