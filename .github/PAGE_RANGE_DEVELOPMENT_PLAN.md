## 🚀 Phase 6: Word Document Page Range Export

### Objectives
- Implement page range selection for Word documents
- Support both .docx and .doc formats
- Export selected pages to Markdown format
- Integrate with existing PageRangeSelector UI

### Technical Considerations
**Word Document Page Concept**:
- Word documents don't have fixed "pages" like PDFs
- Page breaks depend on content, formatting, and rendering
- Need to define "page" boundaries (e.g., page breaks, sections, or content chunks)

**Implementation Approaches**:
1. **Section-based**: Export by document sections
2. **Page-break-based**: Parse and respect explicit page breaks
3. **Content-chunk-based**: Divide by headings or paragraph count
